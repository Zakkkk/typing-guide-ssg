## Practise for the Beginner

As a *rough* guideline I would consider a typist a beginner if they cannot achieve the following speeds:

- 110 wpm on a standard 60s test on [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWCO2WAukA).
- 80 wpm on a 60s MonkeyType test [with the English 10k language](https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWA+gIwAMA1gjtlgLpA) option.

If you have not achieved these speeds then this section aims to teach you what is necessary. I believe that anyone with healthy hands and some spare time can achieve these speeds.

### Memorising Your Layout

This section assumes that you cannot touch type (i.e. type without looking at your keyboard) on the layout that you are using.

The fastest way to learn your layout will be to throw yourself into the deep end and just start typing on it! It is possible to gradually introduce new keys to yourself through Keybr and MonkeyType, however, it will be faster to learn the keys at the same time due to diminishing returns slowing down the 'mastery' of a key. You should not be looking at any sort of keymap or keyboard, whether thats on screen or physically when you are memorising your layout. The idea is that you want it to be costly for your brain to forget a key, which strongly encourages it to remember each key. Do not be discouraged when you make mistakes; a high level of accuracy is not realistic at this stage of learning. You can look at the layout every now and then, or try pressing around, or using mnemonics if you get stuck. Expect it to take anywhere from 20 minutes to two days to memorise your layout completely.

### The Beginner Method
In the beginner stages, a lack of muscle memory is usually the culprit for a lack of speed. To develop this muscle memory I recommend:

- You set a goal of accurately typing out a larger wordlist, with the punctuation setting enabled. Switch the language setting on MonkeyType to English 10k, this will contain the top 10 thousand words in English. This will be a diverse set of words and you may even encounter words which you have never typed before.
- You should also turn on the punctuation setting to get a feel for where all the punctuation keys are on your layout. I no longer practise with punctuation, however, I benefited greatly from starting out with it.
- The length of the test is up to you, starting with 25 or 50 words is a good idea, as a timed test may cut you off when you are in the middle of a word.

I suggest moving to the intermediates section of this guide when you have reached the speeds as stated, or have plateaud for months despite continuous of practise.
