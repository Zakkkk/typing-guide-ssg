## Practice for the Beginner

As a *rough* guideline I would consider a typist a beginner if they cannot achieve the following speeds:

- 110 wpm on a standard 60s test on [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWCO2WAukA).
- 80 wpm on a 60s Monkeytype test [with the English 10k language](https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWA+gIwAMA1gjtlgLpA) option.

If you have not achieved these speeds then this section aims to teach you what is necessary. I believe that anyone with healthy hands and some spare time can achieve these speeds.

### Memorising Your Layout

This section assumes that you cannot touch type (i.e. type without looking at your keyboard) on the layout that you are using.

The fastest way to learn your layout will be to throw yourself into the deep end and just start typing on it! It is possible to gradually introduce new keys to yourself through Keybr and Monkeytype, however, it will be faster to learn the keys at the same time due to diminishing returns slowing down the ‘mastery’ of a key. You should not be looking at any sort of keymap or keyboard, whether that’s on screen or physically when you are memorising your layout. The idea is that you want it to be costly for your brain to forget a key, which strongly encourages it to remember each key. Do not be discouraged when you make mistakes; a high level of accuracy is not realistic at this stage of learning. You can look at the layout every now and then, or try pressing around, or using mnemonics if you get stuck. Expect it to take anywhere from 20 minutes to two days to memorise your layout completely.

### The Beginner Method

In the beginner stages, a lack of muscle memory is usually the culprit for a lack of speed. To develop this muscle memory I recommend:

- You set a goal of accurately typing out a larger wordlist, with the punctuation setting enabled. Switch the language setting on Monkeytype to English 10k, this will contain the top 10 thousand words in English. This will be a diverse set of words and you may even encounter words which you have never typed before.
- You should also turn on the punctuation setting to get a feel for where all the punctuation keys are on your layout. I no longer practise with punctuation, however, I benefited greatly from starting out with it.
- The length of the test is up to you, starting with 25 or 50 words is a good idea, as a timed test may cut you off when you are in the middle of a word.

Occasionally I would advise mixing in some default English (called e200) at a duration of 60s to work on higher speeds and common words.

The amount of time spent in the beginner stage can vary between people. Personally I spent around 40 hours, over the course of three months to achieve 100 wpm on English 10k and 120 on 60s.

I suggest moving to the intermediate section of this guide when you have reached the speeds as stated, or have plateaued for months despite continuous practise.

#### Correcting Errors

In my opinion you should not correct your errors for optimal practise. This is because you run the risk of adding the backspace into your muscle memory; something I have experienced a few times. A better solution would be to either skip over the word completely in the case of an error, or use `control+backspace` (`option+backspace` on macOS) to delete the entire word and retype it. Additionally, there is an option in Monkeytype to practise all the words which were typed with errors.

I do not want to overstate the importance of correcting all your errors however, as many errors will be accidental and not stemming from a larger issue. I advise experimenting with this option if you are interested.

#### Switching Full Time

I would not recommend switching layouts full time until you have a speed of about 40 wpm. Switching full time’s main benefit is that you will have more experience in the words and punctuation that you specifically use and rely on the most. Due to the effects of diminishing returns and non-deliberate practise you may not experience the results you were hoping for when switching full time. Nonetheless there are certainly advantages and I do recommend switching full time when you are at an appropriate speed.
