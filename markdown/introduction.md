## Who Am I?

I picked up typing at a young age, when I first got into programming. I recall scoring around 60 words per minute (wpm) at age 10, typing faster than my classmates and even my teacher. Over the years I continued to dabble in typing, but never taking it seriously until I eventually picked up an alternate keyboard layout in 2024. Since, I have amassed over a hundred hours of typing practise, and achieved scores which place me in the top 0.22% of typists, ranked about 1000th on Monkeytype at the time of writing. I have achieved a score of over 200 words per minute on a 15 second test, and a score of over 170 words per minute on a 60 second test. I have been actively observing typing habits of successful and still developing typists and analysed patterns which affect outcomes, which I hope to share to you.
