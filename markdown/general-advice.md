## General Practice Advice

### Which Keyboard Should I Buy?

Many people buy mechanical keyboards in hopes that it improves their typing ability or comfort, however, I think this sentiment is mostly misleading. You only need a keyboard that works, and ideally it is at least a [6 key rollover keyboard](https://www.mechanical-keyboard.org/key-rollover-test/). Personally I prefer using laptop keyboards and membrane keyboards as they are easier to press than the average mechanical keyboard and the keycaps are much lower. You should only buy a mechanical keyboard if you are interested in the customisability or have a general interest in mechanical keyboards and do not have the expectation that it will make you a better typist.

You can also consider buying an [ergonomic keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnnNNLaFZ9Y), however, be aware of all the marketing behind these. Traditional row staggered boards are a completely valid preference.

For what its worth, [the world record](https://youtu.be/G9pB895HubE?si=8a_G7AnFlDZnn3CH) was set on a MacBook keyboard which happens to be my preferred keyboard.

### Dealing with Plateaus

Almost no matter which stage you are at, you can expect to encounter a plateau of some sort. In these times it is important to note that progress is not linear and that your practise is likely not wasted. Depending on the length of your plateau I would either keep practising in the same manner as you currently are, or change up the test you are doing. Changing the test will likely give you a bout of visible progress, keeping your spirits high.

### Get Better Sleep!

A very underrated component of typing practise is the quality and amount of sleep per night. According [to this study](https://osf.io/rd8n3/overview), increasing the sleep duration by 60-90 minutes, lead to an improvement in performance of musicians on their instruments.

> These differences highlight sleep’s facilitative role in consolidating motor skills, cognitive function, and musical memory. Results highlight the substantial benefits of sleep extension for musicians’ performance and wellbeing.

It is a common experience amongst typists that typing quality improves upon after waking up from sleep. This experience will be most felt in the early and beginner stages of learning to type.

### Warm Hands

Take a shower or do some exercise to warm up your hands for typing. Typing with cold hands is difficult.
