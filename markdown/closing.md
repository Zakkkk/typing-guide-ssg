### Why This Guide Exists

I have been asked a few times why I would create this guide when others already exist. The answer is simple:

- Existing typing guides I have seen do not fully capture my opinions; Either they include over dogmatic information which I do not agree with or lack information which I believe is important.
- I want a place to easily reference my opinions and thoughts without needing to recall all the details.
