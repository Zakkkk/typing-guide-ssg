## Practice for Intermediates and Beyond

Roughly there are four distinct skills in typing:

- Raw finger speed and coordination: The ability to coordinate and move your fingers fast.
- Endurance: The ability to maintain a relatively high speed for extended periods.
- Flow: The ability to type with low variance of speeds between words.
- Range: A familiarity with a wide range of words and letter combinations.

It is commonly the case that one or more of these skills may be the bottleneck for typing improvement, and thus it is wise to cycle through different tests which target the aforementioned skills.

### Developing Finger Speed and Coordination

This is likely the most important skill beyond the beginner stage for improvement. This will be the foundation for your improvement. How did I come to this conclusion?

When a typist picks up a new alt layout, it is observed that they will quickly return to their old speeds before slowing down in their rate of progress. The only key variable that remained the same was that they kept the same level of finger speed and coordination.

### Developing Endurance

This will not be as useful for everyday typing for many people, as every day typing is often done in shorter bursts between messages or between thoughts.

### Developing Flow

This skill is vital for longer tests such as 60s or 120s, or when transcribing longer texts of which you know all the content you need to type. For example, if you are copying down spoken text, or copying from something written on paper.

This skill can be developed on tests that are at least 60 seconds long. A variety of language options can be chosen, for example, e200, e1k, and e10k are all good options and target a slightly different part of your flow.

When doing these tests I recommend resetting infrequently, and focusing on slowing down on sections with words which you are less confident in, and naturally speeding up on sections which contain easy words.

#### Problem Words

You may find that there are some words which you cannot type accurately, consistently. For such words I would recommend slowing down more when you encounter these such that you do not make a mistake, as a mistake often has more of a speed penalty than slowing down.

### What About Accuracy?

You might have noticed that I did not include accuracy as one of the distinct skills. This is because I believe inaccuracies come from trying to type at a speed of which you are not capable. Whilst this is important for your practise, you should slow down if you are typing with too many errors.

You also may not be as inaccurate as you think, as your average accuracy statistic is incomplete. This is because most people will reset their tests more often than not, making your completion rate a more accurate measurement of your accuracy.
