## Practice for Intermediates and Beyond

Roughly there are four distinct skills in typing:

- Raw finger speed and coordination: The ability to coordinate and move your fingers fast.
- Endurance: The ability to maintain a relatively high speed for extended periods.
- Flow: The ability to type with low variance of speeds between words.
- Range: A familiarity with a wide range of words and letter combinations.

It is commonly the case that one or more of these skills may be the bottleneck for typing improvement, and thus it is wise to cycle through different tests which target the aforementioned skills.

### Developing Finger Speed and Coordination

This is likely the most important skill beyond the beginner stage for improvement. How did I come to this conclusion?

When a typist picks up a new alt layout, it is observed that they will quickly return to their old speeds before slowing down in their rate of progress. The only key variable that remained the same was that they kept the same level of finger speed and coordination.

#### Problem Words

You may find that there are some words which you cannot

### Developing Range
