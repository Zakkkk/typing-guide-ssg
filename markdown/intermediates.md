## Practice for Intermediates and Beyond

Roughly there are four distinct skills in typing:

- **Raw finger speed and coordination**: The ability to coordinate and move your fingers fast.
- **Endurance**: The ability to maintain a relatively high speed for extended periods.
- **Flow**: The ability to type with low variance of speeds between words.
- **Range**: A familiarity with a wide range of words and letter combinations.

It is commonly the case that one or more of these skills may be the bottleneck for typing improvement, and thus it is wise to **cycle through different tests** which target the aforementioned skills.

### Developing Finger Speed and Coordination

**This is likely the most important skill beyond the beginner stage for improvement.** This will be the foundation for your improvement. How did I come to this conclusion?

When a typist picks up a new alt layout, it is observed that they will quickly return to their old speeds before slowing down in their rate of progress. The only key variable that remained the same was that they kept the same level of finger speed and coordination.

Additionally from observations of myself and other typists, I have seen a correlation between finger speed and typing ability. There is significant overlap with typists who also play an instrument, or play rhythm games such as *Osu!*. You may think that your finger speed is not your limiting factor, however, even typing at lower speeds becomes far easier once your maximum speed has been raised.

For some, a high degree of finger speed and coordination is genetic, or has been developed without realising, leading to some understating the importance of this skill, or claiming that it is something that should occur naturally. This is certainly true or some, but misleading for the majority of typists.

I believe if you are stuck in your improvement despite continued practise, this can be the key to unlocking a burst of improvement.

To train this skill the key is to push yourself enough such that you make mistakes and need to reset the test. Ideally this is paired with a simple wordlist like e200 and a short test of length 15s or less. Personally the vast majority of my practise has been with e200 15s and I have seen enormous benefit and carryover.

#### Developing Finger Speed with Quotes

Many have developed their finger speed and coordination through quotes, and if this option is appealing to you, then you should continue with it. However, there are some issues with this method in my opinion. If you are the type of person who enjoys speedrunning or having many attempts on the same quote, then you may find yourself particularly enjoying ghosting (repeating the same quote numerous times) a quote repeatedly. However, personally I find this to be very frustrating, much less than having a new set of words as would the case when typing on a e200 15s test. For this reason I do not use quotes to train my finger speed.

### Developing Flow

This skill is vital for longer tests such as 60s or 120s, or when transcribing longer texts of which you know all the content you need to type. For example, if you are copying down spoken text, or copying from something written on paper. This skill, paired with a high finger speed, can make typing far more enjoyable and efficient.

This skill can be developed on tests that are at least 60 seconds long. A variety of language options can be chosen, for example, e200, e1k (English 1k), e10k, and long quotes are all good options and target a slightly different part of your flow.

When doing these tests I recommend resetting infrequently, and focusing on slowing down on sections with words which you are less confident in, and naturally speeding up on sections which contain easy words.

#### Problem Words

You may find that there are some words which you cannot type accurately, consistently. For such words I would recommend slowing down more when you encounter these such that you do not make a mistake, as a mistake often has more of a speed penalty than slowing down.

### Developing Range

Developing range may not be necessary if use the same layout in your everyday typing and depending on what you type out each day. However, it may still be worth practising for you. Conveniently there is a plethora of resources for this. If you wish to stick with Monkeytype, I would advise using larger dictionaries like English 1k, English 10k, even English 450k, or your favourite programming language. Also consider using the punctuation setting. If you wish to look outside of Monkeytype I recommend [Entertrained](https://entertrained.app/), a site where you can type out books. For the goal of developing range, it may be more worthwhile repeating missed words. You should focus on typing these words out with high accuracy, and minimal resets.

### Developing Endurance

This will not be as useful for everyday typing for many people, as every day typing is often done in shorter bursts between messages or between thoughts. Nonetheless, it can be a cool skill to develop. In my opinion a test with length 60s is the minimum amount of time needed to develop this, with 120s fitting better. Long quotes are another great option.

Setting a pace caret on Monkeytype may be a nice idea to target maintaining a certain speed for the duration of the test.

### Putting it All Together

I recommend cycling through different tests to focus on a different skill. For example, I might spend a few weeks trying to get a certain record on a test like *English 200, 60s* or *English 10k, zipf, 120s*, or I might spend a few weeks specifically focusing on completing more quotes. I do recommend keeping some form of finger speed training in your program though, as this is a very foundational skill. Additionally, it is a skill which can fade quicker than the others.

By rotating through different tests you can be sure that you are probably not missing anything extremely important for your typing practise. There is also a mental aspect as you will be seeing improvement after possibly not seeing any for an extended period of time.

One idea of structuring your practise is to do so with objectives, for example choosing a single objective such as:

- Achieving 90% of your record, 3 times.
- Achieving 85% of your record, 10 times.
- Complete 10 tests.
- Complete 3 tests with above 99% accuracy.

This is not strictly necessary, however, for some it can be a nice way of thinking about your practise.

#### Consistency

For an optimal practise regimen you should type every day. Typing every day may not be applicable to everyone, but in general, spreading your typing practise out to more days is going to be better than having a few long typing sessions. Typing 10-30 minutes every day is going to be sufficient for results for a long time. If you wish to type more I would recommend spacing out your practise sessions throughout the day instead of typing continuously.

### A Case Against ‘Realistic Practise’

A common critique against different mode’s of practise like e200, or 15s is that it does not reflect realistic typing conditions. However, do not think that just because a test is realistic, it is the best way to improve realistic typing. To use an analogy, when an athlete is in the gym to improve for their sport, they are not necessarily doing movements which mimic what they do in their sport. Instead, they are going to practise the fundamental movements like a squat or deadlift. The same logic will apply with your typing practise.

If simulating realistic typing was all that mattered, you would see more people who do realistic typing for a living reach high speeds, but I have not observed many people who type for a living to be fast. Additionally, a few weeks of dedicated practise will have you reaching speeds surpassing people who only type when necessary.

### What About Accuracy?

You might have noticed that I did not include accuracy as one of the distinct skills. This is because I believe inaccuracies come from trying to type at a speed of which you are not capable. Whilst this is important for your practise, you should slow down if you are typing with too many errors. You should also make sure to **really focus on the typing** to increase your accuracy.

You also may not be as inaccurate as you think, as your average accuracy statistic is incomplete. This is because most people will reset their tests more often than not, making your completion rate a more accurate measurement of your accuracy.
