## Foundations

It is generally a good idea to have decent typing form, even if it means a minor (perhaps major) setback in your current typing ability. [High speeds are achievable with less than ideal technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwH4er-YcyI), although they have been achieved in spite of the technique, not because of it; You could even argue they would be faster if they had learnt better technique.

This is what I believe constitutes most of good typing technique, on a basic level:

- Using at least 6 fingers, and an additional thumb.
- Looking only at the screen when you type.
- Using a thumb for the space.
- Not resting your wrists when typing.

The overarching reasons for these is that it increases your typing efficiency. There will be less finger and head movement, meaning that your finger and eye speed will be less of a limiting factor concerning your typing speed.
