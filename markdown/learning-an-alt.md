## Why You Should Learn an Alternative Layout

In order to make QWERTY feasible as a layout for challenging speeds, virtually all typists need to employ complex alt-fingering techniques. Alt-fingering is when a typist uses a finger for a key which deviates from the standard home row typing technique commonly taught in schools.

When using the standard home row technique we get many uncomfortable words such as:

- Followed
- Decided
- Much
- Crazy

These are uncomfortable because they involve slow, consecutive finger usage (known as a same finger bigram, or SFB), scissors like `cr`, and plenty of hand movement with general typing. These issues are exacerbated when typing at high speeds too. Many of these problems can be solved through in-depth planning with alt-fingering; However, this takes time and deliberation, and in many cases is not as comfortable as it would be otherwise with no alt-fingering.

One massive advantage of using an alternate keyboard layout is that you get all the benefits from complicated alt-fingering, without any of the mental effort required to plan this out and personalise it. It is much simpler to advise a general population to learn a modern alt layout than it is to advise to work through common words and testing if each word is comfortable, to evaluate the necessity of an alt layout. Also a word may become uncomfortable down the line after speed has been gained.

Additionally, I believe that using a modern layout will make you a faster typist. Admittedly we have no studies or formalised trials on this, and this is just my personal opinion. The reason I believe a modern layout will improve your speed is because it is obvious that [worse layouts exist](https://layouts.wiki/layouts/2021/vitrimak/). This implies that some layouts are better than others. Modern layouts have far less same finger usage, awkward scissors and patterns, and far more rolls (try out the word `power` on your QWERTY keyboard!). I do not believe I could have reached my current speed, in the time that I did, on QWERTY, due to the discrepancy in rolls and same finger usage.

Since so many people learnt to type at a young age, or without guidance, you might find yourself possessing numerous bad keyboard habits. Learning an alt layout is the perfect opportunity to reset your bad habits and restart with ideal fundamentals. If you are using an ergonomic keyboard, this is also another ideal time to start learning. This is because alt-fingering is more difficult on an ergonomic keyboard due to the rows of keys not having a stagger.

### Will It Take Me Another 20 Years to Build up My Speed?

A common misconception! Just because you spent 10 years on one layout, it does not mean it will take another 10 years of practise to return to your QWERTY level. From my observations, it takes roughly 3 months to return to your old speed. This is because much of your skill can transfer over, namely your finger speed and coordination. The same logic applies to the scenarios in which a musician has an easier time picking up a second instrument, or an athlete picking up a new sport.

	*“How long did it take to reach your old QWERTY speeds?” A survey was undertaken in the AKL Discord server. Speed of respondents ranged from ~40-200 wpm. There were 18 respondents.*

Dedicated practise will always win over mindless usage (more to come on this later!) - another reason why it will not take an exorbitant amount of time to return to old speeds. In many cases, the habit of dedicated practise will be formed out of necessity due to an absence of ability on the new layout, leading to speeds greater than what was achieved on QWERTY. Additionally, you will only need about 10-30 minutes of daily practise to build your speed back up. This can easily be done whilst still using QWERTY day-to-day. Do not worry about your QWERTY speeds falling after learning an alt-layout, this will not happen, especially if you do occasional practise on QWERTY.

### What About Keyboard Shortcuts?

As for keyboard shortcuts, you have two simple options. You can either keep the QWERTY shortcuts (i.e. a QWERTY layer when holding down the modifier keys) or you can just adapt to the new shortcut locations. I have tried both and I personally prefer using the new positions for my shortcuts.

### Which Layout Should I Learn?

You should learn a modern layout, as layouts like Dvorak were made almost a century ago, long before computer analysis. Even layouts like Colemak have been improved upon significantly.

To keep things simple, I would recommend learning [Sturdy](https://oxey.dev/sturdy/index.html), the layout I am currently using, because it is particularly high in rolls, resulting in an increased number of words which you can burst through. It also features a low amount of redirects, which are sequences such as `dfa` or `dsf`, these sequences involve reversing the direction which you are rolling and are more inaccurate based on my and others’ experience.

If you wish to spend more time evaluating which layout to learn, I would recommend looking into:

### When Should You Not Learn an Alternative Layout

Whilst learning a modern layout can be a worthwhile investment for many, there are certainly people who will not benefit as much. If you find yourself in one of the following scenarios, you should consider staying on QWERTY:

- You do not own your hardware and cannot administer the software: for instance if you use a school or work laptop where you do not have permission to change the software.
- You do not have the necessary time required to consistently practise the new layout. Expect to spend 15-30 hours to return to higher speeds, over the course of a month or so.
- You do not have any typing ambitions beyond the beginner stage.

Additionally, it is probably a good idea to have a base level of QWERTY ability as it is likely you will use a QWERTY keyboard at some point.

### Advice for Remaining on QWERTY

If you have decided to remain on QWERTY, you should look into alt-fingering. I would suggest asking around in the Monkeytype Discord Server, and going through the most common words to test out if a particular word feels difficult or slow to type with the homerow method. Then use this personalised feedback to find an ideal alt-fingering sequence for you.
