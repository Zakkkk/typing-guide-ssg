I recall scoring around 60 words per minute (wpm) at age 10, typing faster than my classmates and even my teacher. Over the years I continued to dabble in typing, but never taking it seriously until I eventually picked up an alternate keyboard layout in 2024. Since, I have amassed over a hundred hours of typing practise, and achieved scores which place me in the top 0.22% of typists, ranked about 1000th on MonkeyType at the time of writing. I have achieved a score of over 200 words per minute on a 15 second test, and a score of over 170 words per minute on a 60 second test. I have been actively observing typing habits of successful and still developing typists and analysed patterns which effect outcomes, which I hope to share to you.</p><h2 id="foundations">Foundations</h2><p>It is generally a good idea to have decent typing form, even if it means a minor (perhaps major) setback in your current typing ability. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwH4er-YcyI">High speeds are achievable with less than ideal technique</a>, although they have been achieved in spite of the technique, not because of it; You could even argue they would be faster if they had learnt better technique.</p><p>This is what I believe constitutes most of good typing technique, on a basic level:</p><ul><li>Using at least 6 fingers, and an additional thumb.</li><li>Looking only at the screen when you type.</li><li>Using a thumb for the space.</li><li>Not resting your wrists when typing.</li></ul><p>The overarching reasons for these is that it increases your typing efficiency. There will be less finger and head movement, meaning that your finger and eye speed will be less of a limiting factor concerning your typing speed.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-learn-an-alternative-layout">Why You Should Learn an Alternative Layout</h2><p>In order to make QWERTY feasible as a layout for challenging speeds, virtually all typists need to employ complex alt-fingering techniques. Alt-fingering is when a typist uses a finger for a key which deviates from the standard home row typing technique commonly taught in schools.</p><p><img alt="The home row typing technique." src="img/homerow.webp" /></p><p>When using the standard home row technique we get many uncomfortable words such as:</p><ul><li>Followed</li><li>Decided</li><li>Much</li><li>Crazy</li></ul><p>These are uncomfortable because they involve slow, consecutive finger usage (known as a same finger bigram, or SFB), scissors like <code>cr</code>, and plenty of hand movement with general typing. These issues are exacerbated when typing at high speeds too. Many of these problems can be solved through in-depth planning with alt-fingering; However, this takes time and deliberation, and in many cases is not as comfortable as it would be otherwise with no alt-fingering.</p><p>One massive advantage of using an <a href="https://discord.gg/keyboard-layouts">alternate keyboard layout</a> is that you get all the benefits from complicated alt-fingering, without any of the mental effort required to plan this out and personalise it. It is much simpler to advise a general population to learn a modern alt layout than it is to advise them to work through all the common words, testing if each word is comfortable or not, not considering that a word may become uncomfortable down the line after speed has been gained.</p><p>Additionally, I believe that using a modern layout will make you a faster typist. Admittedly we have no studies or formalised trials on this, and this is just my personal opinion. The reason I believe a modern layout will improve your speed is because it is obvious that <a href="https://layouts.wiki/layouts/2021/vitrimak/">worse layouts exist</a>. This implies that some layouts are better than others. Modern layouts have far less same finger usage, awkward scissors and patterns, and far more rolls (try out the word <code>power</code> on your QWERTY keyboard!). I do not believe I could have reached my current speed, in the time that I did, on QWERTY, due to the discrepancy in rolls and same finger usage.</p><p>Since so many people learnt to type at a young age, or without guidance, you might find yourself possessing numerous bad keyboard habits. Learning an alt layout is the perfect opportunity to reset your bad habits and restart with ideal fundamentals. If you are using an ergonomic keyboard, this is also another ideal time to start learning. This is because alt-fingering is more difficult on an ergonomic keyboard due to the rows of keys not having a stagger.</p><h3 id="&quot;will-it-take-me-another-20-years-to-build-up-my-speed?&quot;">&quot;Will it Take Me Another 20 Years to Build up My Speed?&quot;</h3><p>A common misconception! Just because you spent 10 years on one layout, it does not mean it will take another 10 years of practise to return to your QWERTY level. From my observations, it takes roughly 3 months to return to your old speed. This is because much of your skill can transfer over, namely your finger speed and coordination. The same logic applies to the scenarios in which a musician has an easier time picking up a second instrument, or an athlete picking up a new sport.</p><p><img alt="Chart showing the amount of time taken to return to QWERTY speed." src="img/return-to-qwerty.svg" /></p><p><em>&quot;How long did it take to reach your old QWERTY speeds?&quot; A survey was undertaken in the AKL Discord server. Speed of respondents ranged from ~40-200 wpm. There were 18 respondents.</em></p><p>Dedicated practise will always win over mindless usage (more to come on this later!) - another reason why it will not take an exorbitant amount of time to return to old speeds. In many cases, the habit of dedicated practise will be formed out of necessity due to an absence of ability on the new layout, leading to speeds greater than what was achieved on QWERTY. Additionally, you will only need about 10-30 minutes of daily practise to build your speed back up. This can easily be done whilst still using QWERTY day-to-day. Do not worry about your QWERTY speeds falling after learning an alt-layout, this will not happen, especially if you do occasional practise on QWERTY.</p><h3 id="&quot;what-about-keyboard-shortcuts?&quot;">&quot;What About Keyboard Shortcuts?&quot;</h3><p>As for keyboard shortcuts, you have two simple options. You can either keep the QWERTY shortcuts (i.e. a QWERTY layer when holding down the modifier keys) or you can just adapt to the new shortcut locations. I have tried both and I personally prefer using the new positions for my shortcuts.</p><h3 id="&quot;so,-which-layout-should-i-learn?&quot;">&quot;So, Which Layout Should I Learn?&quot;</h3><p>You should learn a modern layout, as layouts like Dvorak were made almost a century ago, long before computer analysis. Even layouts like Colemak have been improved upon significantly.</p><p>To keep things simple, I would recommend learning <a href="https://oxey.dev/sturdy/index.html">Sturdy</a>, the layout I am currently using, because it is particularly high in rolls, resulting in an increased number of words which you can burst through. It also features a low amount of redirects, which are sequences such as <code>dfa</code> or <code>dsf</code>, these sequences involve reversing the direction which you are rolling and are more inaccurate based on my and others&apos; experience.</p><p>If you wish to spend more time evaluating which layout to learn, I would recommend looking into:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Apsu/Canary">Canary</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium">Gallium</a></li><li><a href="https://layouts.wiki/layouts/2024/rain/">Rain</a></li><li><a href="https://www.valorance.org/night/">Night</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://layouts.wiki/guides/start/recommendations/">Or reading this article for choosing an alternative layout</a>. Additionally, you can also join <a href="https://discord.gg/keyboard-layouts">the AKL Discord</a>!</p><p>To install a layout, please see the <a href="https://layouts.wiki/guides/start/software/">layouts wiki guide</a>.</p><h3 id="when-should-you-not-learn-an-alternative-layout">When Should You Not Learn an Alternative Layout</h3><p>Whilst learning a modern layout can be a worthwhile investment for many, there are certainly people who will not benefit as much. If you find yourself in one of the following scenarios, you should consider staying on QWERTY:</p><ul><li>You do not own your hardware and cannot administer the software: for instance if you use a school or work laptop where you do not have permission to change the software.</li><li>You do not have the necessary time required to consistently practise the new layout. Expect to spend 15-30 hours to return to higher speeds, over the course of a month or so.</li></ul><p>Additionally it is probably a good idea to have a base level of QWERTY ability as it is likely you will use a QWERTY keyboard at some point.</p><h3 id="advice-for-remaining-on-qwerty">Advice for Remaining on QWERTY</h3><p>If you have decided to remain on QWERTY, you should look into alt-fingering. I would suggest asking around in the MonkeyType Discord Server, and going through the most common words to test out if a particular word feels difficult or slow to type with the homerow method. Then use this personalised feedback to find an ideal alt-fingering sequence for you.</p><h2 id="practise-for-the-beginner">Practise for the Beginner</h2><p>As a <em>rough</em> guideline I would consider a typist a beginner if they cannot achieve the following speeds:</p><ul><li>110 wpm on a standard 60s test on <a href="https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWCO2WAukA">MonkeyType</a>.</li><li>80 wpm on a 60s MonkeyType test <a href="https://monkeytype.com?testSettings=NoIgLglgtgpiA0A7ArgG1UtGXs7kMiA5qhAM4AWA+gIwAMA1gjtlgLpA">with the English 10k language</a> option.</li></ul><p>If you have not achieved these speeds then this section aims to teach you what is necessary. I believe that anyone with healthy hands and some spare time can achieve these speeds.</p><h3 id="memorising-your-layout">Memorising Your Layout</h3><p>This section assumes that you cannot touch type (i.e. type without looking at your keyboard) on the layout that you are using.</p><p>The fastest way to learn your layout will be to throw yourself into the deep end and just start typing on it! It is possible to gradually introduce new keys to yourself through Keybr and MonkeyType, however, it will be faster to learn the keys at the same time due to diminishing returns slowing down the &apos;mastery&apos; of a key. You should not be looking at any sort of keymap or keyboard, whether thats on screen or physically when you are memorising your layout. The idea is that you want it to be costly for your brain to forget a key, which strongly encourages it to remember each key. Do not be discouraged when you make mistakes; a high level of accuracy is not realistic at this stage of learning. You can look at the layout every now and then, or try pressing around, or using mnemonics if you get stuck. Expect it to take anywhere from 20 minutes to two days to memorise your layout completely.</p><h3 id="the-beginner-method">The Beginner Method</h3><p>In the beginner stages, a lack of muscle memory is usually the culprit for a lack of speed. To develop this muscle memory I recommend:</p><ul><li>You set a goal of accurately typing out a larger wordlist, with the punctuation setting enabled. Switch the language setting on MonkeyType to English 10k, this will contain the top 10 thousand words in English. This will be a diverse set of words and you may even encounter words which you have never typed before.</li><li>You should also turn on the punctuation setting to get a feel for where all the punctuation keys are on your layout. I no longer practise with punctuation, however, I benefited greatly from starting out with it.</li><li>The length of the test is up to you, starting with 25 or 50 words is a good idea, as a timed test may cut you off when you are in the middle of a word.</li></ul><p>Occasionally I would advise mixing in some default english (called e200) at a duration of 60s to work on higher speeds and common words.</p><p>The amount of time spent in the beginner stage can vary between people. Personally I spent around 40 hours, over the course of three months to achieve 100 wpm on English 10k and 120 on 60s.</p><p>I suggest moving to the intermediate section of this guide when you have reached the speeds as stated, or have plateaud for months despite continuous of practise.</p><h4 id="correcting-errors">Correcting Errors</h4><p>In my opinion you should not correct your errors for optimal practise. This is because you run the risk of adding the backspace into your muscle memory, something I have experienced a few times. A better solution would be to either skip over the word completely in the case of an error, or use <code>control+backspace</code> (<code>option+backspace</code> on MacOS) to delete the entire word and retype it. Additionally there is an option in Monkeytype to practise all of the words which were typed with errors.</p><p><img alt="A screenshot showing the repeat missed words button." src="img/repeat-errors.png" /></p><p>I do not want to overstate the importance of correcting all your errors however, as many errors will be accidental and not stemming from a bigger issue. I advise experimenting with this option if you are interested.</p><h2 id="practise-for-intermediates-and-beyond">Practise for Intermediates and Beyond</h2><p>Roughly there are four distinct skills in typing:</p><ul><li>Raw finger speed and coordination: The ability to coordinate and move your fingers fast.</li><li>Endurance: The ability to maintain a relatively high speed for extended periods.</li><li>Flow: The ability to type with low variance of speeds between words.</li><li>Range: A familiarity with a wide range of words and letter combinations.</li></ul><p>It is commonly the case that one or more of these skills may be the bottleneck for typing improvement, and thus it is wise to cycle through different tests which target the aforementioned skills.</p><h3 id="developing-finger-speed-and-coordination">Developing Finger Speed and Coordination</h3><p>This is likely the most important skill beyond the beginner stage for improvement.</p><h4 id="problem-words">Problem Words</h4><p>You may find that there are some words which you cannot</p><h2 id="general-practise-advice">General Practise Advice</h2></article></main></body></html>
